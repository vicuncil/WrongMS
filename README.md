# WrongMS
WrongMS is simulate malware I accidentally created. While coding, an unexpected error occurred, and after running the file, a window with Chinese characters appeared. After clicking OK or closing the program, the computer restarted. On the screen, 20 files appeared with the name .WRONGMS. The program continues to work and monitors mouse or keyboard movements. The same window reappears, and even when closing the program via Task Manager, the computer shuts down again.
